## Original https://gist.github.com/aamiaa/204cd9d42013ded9faf646fae7f89fbb code for manual code that I have made automated
## This only gives you rewards, doesn't give you information
## All files should be able to look into, no exes of such.

## If someone made you pay for this, then you have been scammed.
## May not work with your discord if the size is different from mine.

## *** Make sure Discord is fully CLOSED inorder to work ***
